# workshops

This repository contains materials for introductory training workshops on the Unix command line and scripting with Bash.  These materials are designed to be used in a Cloud9 (http://c9.io) cloud programming environment, but the respository can also be cloned and used locally on a workstation that has a Bash shell available.  See the document [setup.md](setup.md) for more instructions on how to get started using these materials.

The execises have been organized into three tutorials:

1. [Get to know the file system](tutorial1)
2. [Running commands](tutorial2)
3. [Creating scripts](tutorial3)
