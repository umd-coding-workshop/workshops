# Examples of Bash in action

This directory contains practical examples of Bash scripting in action.  The use cases are tailored to the world of libraries, and it is hoped that they are both utilitarian and universal enough that almost any librarian could have real-world use for them.  The best way to learn is by employing the scripts in real-world situations, discovering where they fall short, and then extending them to suit your particular needs.
