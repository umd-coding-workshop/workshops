# How to use these materials

## File Structure

These materials are designed to be used while at the command prompt in a Bash shell environment.  They are organized into three tutorials, corresponding to three planned workshops, with each tutorial divided into several exercises covering a more or less coherent set of activities relating to some aspect of scripting in Bash.  The tutorials are designed to build on one another, so it is recommended that you proceed in order. For each tutorial and exercise, the README.md file provides the instructions on how to proceed through the individual tasks. The other files in the folder are used in the individual tasks in the exercise.

## Getting Bash

For Mac and Linux users, a Bash environment is available simply by opening the terminal application (most likely by default, though whether Bash is the default shell environment depends on your particular OS/distribution).  On Windows the situation is more difficult, though Windows 10 now includes a Bash environment by default, so things seem to be getting somewhat more convenient on the Windows side too (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).  For older versions of Windows, you have to install a system such as Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) which emulates the Bash environment.

## Cloud 9

For this workshop, to get around the issues with the environment, we are using the Cloud 9 cloud programming environment instead.  We'll walk through getting set up on Cloud 9 at the beginning of the workshop.  To create a free Cloud 9 account you will need to supply a credit card number for identity verification, so if you are on Windows and choose not to give Cloud 9 your credit card info, Cygwin is probably your best option.

## Cloning this Repository

Once you have a working Bash environment (either in the Cloud or on your local machine), you'll need to clone this repository to have the files available for the exercises. Navigate through your shell environment to a location where you would like to store the files and type the following command to clone this repository.

  git clone https://github.com/umd-coding-workshop/workshops

This command assumes you have git installed in your environment and that you are able to move to an appropriate directory in your command line interface. If that's not the case, please contact one of the members of the Libraries' Coding Workshop and we'll help you get started.
