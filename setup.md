# How to use these materials

## File Structure

These materials are designed to be used while at the command prompt in a Bash shell environment.  They are organized into three tutorials, corresponding to three planned workshops, with each tutorial divided into several exercises covering a more or less coherent set of activities relating to some aspect of scripting in Bash.  The tutorials are designed to build on one another, so it is recommended that you proceed in order.

## Getting Bash

For Mac and Linux users, a Bash environment is available simply by opening the terminal application (most likely by default, though whether Bash is the default shell environment depends on your particular OS/distribution).  On Windows the situation is more difficult, though Windows 10 now includes a Bash environment by default, so things seem to be getting somewhat more convenient on the Windows side too (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about).  For older versions of Windows, you have to install a system such as Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) which emulates the Bash environment.

## Cloud 9

For this workshop, to get around the issues with the environment, we are using the Cloud 9 cloud programming environment instead.  We'll walk through getting set up on Cloud 9 at the beginning of the workshop.
