Act II, Scene

Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. [Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, cum aliis.

Claudius. Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. 
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke 
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 
Of Hamlet's transformation. So I call it, 
Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man 
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him 
So much from th' understanding of himself, 
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both 
That, being of so young days brought up with him, 
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court 
Some little time; so by your companies 
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather 
So much as from occasion you may glean, 
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

Gertrude. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, 
And sure I am two men there are not living 
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you 
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile 
For the supply and profit of our hope, 
Your visitation shall receive such thanks 
As fits a king's remembrance.

Rosencrantz. Both your Majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, 
Put your dread pleasures more into command 
Than to entreaty.

Guildenstern. But we both obey, 
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
To lay our service freely at your feet, 
To be commanded.

Claudius. Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

Gertrude. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz. 
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son.- Go, some of you, 
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

Guildenstern. Heavens make our presence and our practices 
Pleasant and helpful to him!

Gertrude. Ay, amen!
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, [with some Attendants].

Enter Polonius.

Polonius. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, 
Are joyfully return'd.

Claudius. Thou still hast been the father of good news.

Polonius. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, 
I hold my duty as I hold my soul, 
Both to my God and to my gracious king; 
And I do think- or else this brain of mine 
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath us'd to do- that I have found 
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

Claudius. O, speak of that! That do I long to hear.

Polonius. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors. 
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

Claudius. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. 
[Exit Polonius.] 
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found 
The head and source of all your son's distemper.

Gertrude. I doubt it is no other but the main,
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.

Claudius. Well, we shall sift him. 
[Enter Polonius, Voltemand, and Cornelius.] 
Welcome, my good friends. 
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?

Voltemand. Most fair return of greetings and desires. 
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress 
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd 
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack, 
But better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your Highness; whereat griev'd, 
That so his sickness, age, and impotence 
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests 
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys, 
Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
Makes vow before his uncle never more 
To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty. 
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, 
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee 
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack; 
With an entreaty, herein further shown, 
[Gives a paper.] 
That it might please you to give quiet pass 
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance 
As therein are set down.

Claudius. It likes us well; 
And at our more consider'd time we'll read, 
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour. 
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together. 
Most welcome home! Exeunt Ambassadors.

Polonius. This business is well ended. 
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is, 
Why day is day, night is night, and time is time. 
Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time. 
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, 
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief. Your noble son is mad. 
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, 
What is't but to be nothing else but mad? 
But let that go.

Gertrude. More matter, with less art.

Polonius. Madam, I swear I use no art at all. 
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; 
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure! 
But farewell it, for I will use no art. 
Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect- 
Or rather say, the cause of this defect, 
For this effect defective comes by cause. 
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. 

Perpend.
I have a daughter (have while she is mine), 
Who in her duty and obedience, mark, 
Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise. 
[Reads] the letter.] 
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,'-
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile phrase. 
But you shall hear. Thus: 

[Reads.] 
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'

Gertrude. Came this from Hamlet to her?

Polonius. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful. [Reads.] 
'Doubt thou the stars are fire; 
Doubt that the sun doth move; 
Doubt truth to be a liar; 
But never doubt I love.
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to 
reckon my groans; but that I love thee best, O most best, believe 
it. Adieu. 
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to 
him, HAMLET.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me; 
And more above, hath his solicitings, 
As they fell out by time, by means, and place, 
All given to mine ear.

Claudius. But how hath she
Receiv'd his love?

Polonius. What do you think of me?

Claudius. As of a man faithful and honourable.

Polonius. I would fain prove so. But what might you think, 
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
(As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that, 
Before my daughter told me), what might you, 
Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think, 
If I had play'd the desk or table book, 
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight? 
What might you think? No, I went round to work 
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: 
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star. 
This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort, 
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. 
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice, 
And he, repulsed, a short tale to make, 
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, 
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, 
Into the madness wherein now he raves, 
And all we mourn for.

Claudius. Do you think 'tis this?

Gertrude. it may be, very like.

Polonius. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that- 
That I have Positively said 'Tis so,' 
When it prov'd otherwise.?

Claudius. Not that I know.

Polonius. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this be otherwise. 
If circumstances lead me, I will find 
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed 
Within the centre.

Claudius. How may we try it further?

Polonius. You know sometimes he walks for hours together 
Here in the lobby.

Gertrude. So he does indeed.

Polonius. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him. 
Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter. If he love her not, 
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon 
Let me be no assistant for a state, 
But keep a farm and carters.

Claudius. We will try it.
Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.


Gertrude. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

Polonius. Away, I do beseech you, both away 
I'll board him presently. O, give me leave. 
[Exeunt King and Queen, [with Attendants].]
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

Hamlet. Well, God-a-mercy.

Polonius. Do you know me, my lord?

Hamlet. Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

Polonius. Not I, my lord.

Hamlet. Then I would you were so honest a man.

Polonius. Honest, my lord?

Hamlet. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man 
pick'd out of ten thousand.

Polonius. That's very true, my lord.

Hamlet. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god 
kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?

Polonius. I have, my lord.

Hamlet. Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not 
as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.

Polonius. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet 
he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far 
gone, far gone! And truly in my youth I suff'red much extremity 
for love- very near this. I'll speak to him again.- What do you 
read, my lord?

Hamlet. Words, words, words.

Polonius. What is the matter, my lord?

Hamlet. Between who?

Polonius. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

Hamlet. Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes 
purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a 
plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which, 
sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it 
not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.

Polonius. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.- 
Will You walk out of the air, my lord?

Hamlet. Into my grave?

Polonius. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which 
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I 
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between 
him and my daughter.- My honourable lord, I will most humbly take 
my leave of you.

Hamlet. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more 
willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my 
life,
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Polonius. Fare you well, my lord.

Hamlet. These tedious old fools!

Polonius. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.

Rosencrantz. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
Exit [Polonius].

Guildenstern. My honour'd lord!

Rosencrantz. My most dear lord!

Hamlet. My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, 
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

Rosencrantz. As the indifferent children of the earth.

Guildenstern. Happy in that we are not over-happy.
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.

Hamlet. Nor the soles of her shoe?

Rosencrantz. Neither, my lord.

Hamlet. Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her 
favours?

Guildenstern. Faith, her privates we.

Hamlet. In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a 
strumpet. What news ?

Rosencrantz. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

Hamlet. Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular. What have you, my good friends, 
deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison 
hither?

Guildenstern. Prison, my lord?

Hamlet. Denmark's a prison.

Rosencrantz. Then is the world one.

Hamlet. A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and 
dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.

Rosencrantz. We think not so, my lord.

Hamlet. Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.

Rosencrantz. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your 
mind.

Hamlet. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a 
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.

Guildenstern. Which dreams indeed are ambition; for the very substance of 
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

Hamlet. A dream itself is but a shadow.

Rosencrantz. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that 
it is but a shadow's shadow.

Hamlet. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd 
heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my 
fay, I cannot reason.

Rosencrantz. [with Guildenstern] We'll wait upon you.

Hamlet. No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most 
dreadfully attended. But in the beaten way of friendship, what 
make you at Elsinore?

Rosencrantz. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

Hamlet. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were 
you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free 
visitation? Come, deal justly with me. Come, come! Nay, speak.

Guildenstern. What should we say, my lord?

Hamlet. Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties 
have not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and Queen 
have sent for you.

Rosencrantz. To what end, my lord?

Hamlet. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the 
obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a 
better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with 
me, whether you were sent for or no.

Rosencrantz. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?

Hamlet. [aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold 
not off.

Guildenstern. My lord, we were sent for.

Hamlet. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your 
discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no

feather. I have of late- but wherefore I know not- lost all my 
mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so 
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, 
seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the 
air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
roof fretted with golden fire- why, it appeareth no other thing 
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a 
piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in 
faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in 
action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals! And yet to me what 
is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me- no, nor woman 
neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.

Rosencrantz. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

Hamlet. Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?

Rosencrantz. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten 
entertainment the players shall receive from you. We coted them 
on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you service.

Hamlet. He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall 
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall 
end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose 
lungs are tickle o' th' sere; and the lady shall say her mind 
freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are 
they?

Rosencrantz. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the 
tragedians of the city.

Hamlet. How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in 
reputation and profit, was better both ways.

Rosencrantz. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation.

Hamlet. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the 
city? Are they so follow'd?

Rosencrantz. No indeed are they not.

Hamlet. How comes it? Do they grow rusty?

Rosencrantz. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, 
sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top 
of question and are most tyrannically clapp'd for't. These are now 
the fashion, and so berattle the common stages (so they call 
them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and
dare scarce come thither.

Hamlet. What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they 
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can 
sing? Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow 
themselves to common players (as it is most like, if their means
are no better), their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim 
against their own succession.

Rosencrantz. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy. There was, for a 
while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question.

Hamlet. Is't possible?

Guildenstern. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

Hamlet. Do the boys carry it away?

Rosencrantz. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.

Hamlet. It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and 
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give 
twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in 

little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if 
philosophy could find it out.
Flourish for the Players.

Guildenstern. There are the players.

Hamlet. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th' 
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply 
with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I
tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like 
entertainment than yours. You are welcome. But my uncle-father 
and aunt-mother are deceiv'd.

Guildenstern. In what, my dear lord?

Hamlet. I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
know a hawk from a handsaw.
Enter Polonius.

Polonius. Well be with you, gentlemen!

Hamlet. Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer! 
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
clouts.

Rosencrantz. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
man is twice a child.

Hamlet. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.- 
You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.

Polonius. My lord, I have news to tell you.

Hamlet. My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome-

Polonius. The actors are come hither, my lord.

Hamlet. Buzz, buzz!

Polonius. Upon my honour-

Hamlet. Then came each actor on his ass-

Polonius. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, 
history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, 
tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral; scene 
individable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are 
the only men.

Hamlet. O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

Polonius. What treasure had he, my lord?

Hamlet. Why,
'One fair daughter, and no more, 
The which he loved passing well.'

Polonius. [aside] Still on my daughter.

Hamlet. Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?

Polonius. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
love passing well.

Hamlet. Nay, that follows not.

Polonius. What follows then, my lord?

Hamlet. Why, 
'As by lot, God wot,'
and then, you know, 
'It came to pass, as most like it was.' 
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look 
where my abridgment comes. 
[Enter four or five Players.]
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all.- I am glad to see thee 
well.- Welcome, good friends.- O, my old friend? Why, thy face is 
valanc'd since I saw thee last. Com'st' thou to' beard me in 
Denmark?- What, my young lady and mistress? By'r Lady, your 
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of 
uncurrent gold, be not crack'd within the ring.- Masters, you are 
all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at 
anything we see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a 
taste of your quality. Come, a passionate speech.
First Player. What speech, my good lord?

Hamlet. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; 
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd 
not the million, 'twas caviary to the general; but it was (as I 
receiv'd it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
the top of mine) an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, 
set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said 
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, 
nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of 
affectation; but call'd it an honest method, as wholesome as
sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't 
I chiefly lov'd. 'Twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it 
especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in 
your memory, begin at this line- let me see, let me see: 
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus: 
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms, 
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble 
When he lay couched in the ominous horse, 
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot 
Now is be total gules, horridly trick'd 
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, 
Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets, 
That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire, 
And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore, 
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus 
Old grandsire Priam seeks.' 
So, proceed you.

Polonius. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.

First Player. 'Anon he finds him, 
Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword, 
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls, 
Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide; 
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword 
Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium, 
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top 
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword, 
Which was declining on the milky head 
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' th' air to stick. 
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood, 
And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothing. 
But, as we often see, against some storm, 
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still, 
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below 
As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause, 
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork; 
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall 
On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne, 
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam. 
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods, 
In general synod take away her power; 
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel, 
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!

Polonius. This is too long.

Hamlet. It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on. 
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to 
Hecuba.

First Player. 'But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen-'

Hamlet. 'The mobled queen'?

Polonius. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
First Player. 'Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames 
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe, 
About her lank and all o'erteemed loins, 
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up- 
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd 
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.
But if the gods themselves did see her then, 
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport 
In Mincing with his sword her husband's limbs, 
The instant burst of clamour that she made 
(Unless things mortal move them not at all)
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven 
And passion in the gods.'

Polonius. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's 
eyes. Prithee no more!

Hamlet. 'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you 
hear? Let them be well us'd; for they are the abstract and brief 
chronicles of the time. After your death you were better have a 
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.

Polonius. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.

Hamlet. God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his 
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own 
honour and dignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in 
your bounty. Take them in.

Polonius. Come, sirs.

Hamlet. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow. 
[Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].] 
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murther of 
Gonzago'?

First Player. Ay, my lord.

Hamlet. We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a 
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and 
insert in't, could you not?
First Player. Ay, my lord.

Hamlet. Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[Exit First Player.] 
My good friends, I'll leave you till night. You are welcome to 
Elsinore.

Rosencrantz. Good my lord!

Hamlet. Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern] 
Now I am alone. 
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I! 
Is it not monstrous that this player here, 
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit 
That, from her working, all his visage wann'd, 
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, 
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting 
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
For Hecuba! 
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, 
That he should weep for her? What would he do, 
Had he the motive and the cue for passion 
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech; 
Make mad the guilty and appal the free, 
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed 
The very faculties of eyes and ears. 
Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak 
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, 
And can say nothing! No, not for a king, 
Upon whose property and most dear life 
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? 
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face? 
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat 
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha? 
'Swounds, I should take it! for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall 
To make oppression bitter, or ere this 
I should have fatted all the region kites 
With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain! 
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance! 
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, 
That I, the son of a dear father murther'd, 
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, 
Must (like a whore) unpack my heart with words
And fall a-cursing like a very drab, 
A scullion! 
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! Hum, I have heard 
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, 
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently 
They have proclaim'd their malefactions; 
For murther, though it have no tongue, will speak 
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players 
Play something like the murther of my father
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks; 
I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench, 
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen 
May be a devil; and the devil hath power 
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy, 
As he is very potent with such spirits, 
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds 
More relative than this. The play's the thing 
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. Exit.
