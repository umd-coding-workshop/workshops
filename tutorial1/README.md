In this first tutorial, we will go over the basics of navigating the bash file system. These instructions will take you through several introductory exercises and provide you with easy checkpoints to make sure you are on track.

EXERCISE 1:

1)  Navigate to the 'exercise1' directory by using the cd command.

    'cd exerise1'

Use pwd command to make sure you are in the correct directory.
    
2)  Let's make some files! Make your first file by entering the following command:

    'touch test01.txt'

Use ls command to see the file you've just created.
    
3)  Now let's make some more files. Use the following command to create the rest of the files you'll need for this exerise: 

    'touch test{02..10}.txt'
    
Again, use the ls command to confirm you've correctly created test01.txt - test10.txt.
